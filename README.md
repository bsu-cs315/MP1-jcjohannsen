A tutorial implementation by (Joshua Johannsen).

This project follows the [Your First Game tutorial from
godotengine.org](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

## Project Report

### Reflection
Through this project I learned how easy and user friendly Godot can be. However, I did learn that some things are not inherent, such as the fact that you need to 
manually setup each connection with nodes, instead of just writing the code expecting it to auto-connect. Thankfully, this was a simple fix, with much thanks to my 
professor Paul Gestwicki, and I was able to complete the project without any more hiccups. I look forward to working with Godot more and seeing just how far it can be pushed.

### Self-Evaluation
